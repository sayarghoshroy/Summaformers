dependent cross sections in terms of parton distribution functions and/or fragmentation functions , perturbative hard - scattering functions , and so - called soft factors .", "a crucial feature is that the distribution functions and the soft factor in this factorization are not integrated over the transverse momenta of partons , because these in fact generate the observed transverse momentum @xmath2 . among other things", ", the observables may therefore provide valuable insights into the dependence of parton distributions in nucleons on transverse momentum .", "this becomes particularly interesting when the nucleon is transversely polarized , because there may be correlations between the nucleon spin vector , its momentum , and the parton s transverse momentum .", "one particular correlation , known as the `` sivers effect '' and described by so - called `` sivers functions ''  @xcite , is now widely believed to be involved in a variety of observed hadronic single - spin phenomena .", "closer theoretical studies have revealed that the sivers effect plays an important role in qcd , beyond giving rise to phenomenological functions to be used in the description of single - spin asymmetries .", "a particularly interesting feature is that the sivers effect is not universal in the usual sense , that is , it is not represented by universal probability functions convoluted with partonic hard - scattering cross sections .", "this might at first sight appear to make the study of these functions less interesting .", "however , the non - universality has in fact a clear physical origin , and its closer investigation has turned out to be an extremely important and productive development in qcd . in a nutshell , in order not to be forced to vanish because of the time - reversal symmetry of qcd , single - spin asymmetries require the presence of a strong - interaction phase . for the sivers functions this phase originates from the `` gauge links '' in their definition  @xcite , which are path - ordered exponentials of the gluon field that make the functions gauge - invariant . in dis", ", the gauge link may be viewed as a rescattering of the parton in the color field of the nucleon remnant . that such a final - state rescattering may generate the phase required for a nonzero ssa in semi - inclusive hadron production in dis ( sidis ) was first discovered within a model calculation  @xcite .", "depending on the hard - scattering process , the `` rescattering '' will however manifest itself in different ways .", "for example , for drell - yan lepton pair production in hadronic scattering , _ initial - state _ , rather than final - state , interactions are relevant . as a result , the phase provided by the gauge links is opposite , and the sivers functions for the drell - yan process have opposite sign  @xcite . in more general terms ,", "the nontrivial  universality \" property of the sivers functions is the direct consequence of gauge interactions in quantum chromodynamics  @xcite , and of the qcd factorization theorems applying to the relevant hard processes  @xcite .", "it is a remarkable and fundamental qcd prediction that really tests all concepts we know of for analyzing hard - scattering reactions in strong interactions , and it awaits experimental verification .    while measurements of ssas in sidis are now maturing and have established the presence of sivers - type contributions  @xcite , it will still be a while until precise single - spin measurements in the relatively rare drell - yan process will become feasible at rhic  @xcite or elsewhere  @xcite . however , there are of course other hard - scattering reactions in hadronic collisions for which single - transverse spin asymmetries may be defined , and that may potentially be used in lieu of the drell - yan process for testing the nontrivial", " universality \" properties of the sivers functions . in @xcite , it was proposed to use the ssa in azimuthal correlations of two jets produced in @xmath0 collisions at rhic to learn about the sivers functions . to a first approximation ,", "such dijets are produced by @xmath3 partonic qcd hard - scattering .", "with collinear kinematics , the jets are exactly `` back - to - back '' in the plane perpendicular to the initial beam directions and thus separated by @xmath4 in azimuthal angle in this plane .", "partonic transverse momenta will generate deviations from this topology , because they will lead on average to a non - vanishing net transverse momentum @xmath2 of the jet pair , much smaller than each of the jet transverse momenta @xmath5 individually .", "the observable is therefore of the `` two - scale '' type described above , and as was shown in @xcite , if one proton is polarized , a single - spin asymmetry may be defined that is in principle sensitive to the sivers functions . as", "a caveat , factorization of the spin - dependent cross section for this observable in terms of transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) functions still remains to be established .    unlike the relatively simple cases of sidis and the drell - yan process , where either final - state or initial - state interactions contribute to the sivers asymmetry , both are present for dijet production @xcite", "this complicates the analysis of the process - dependence of the sivers functions considerably , but at the same time it also makes it much more interesting from a theoretical point of view , because the interactions in this case are `` truly qcd '' , that is , they involve the detailed gauge structure of the theory , including for example its non - abelian nature . at the time of @xcite ,", "the process - dependence had not yet been worked out for the case of the ssa in dijet production , so that phenomenological predictions had to remain qualitative , at best . over the last year", ", however , there has been extensive work on deriving and clarifying the structure of the gauge links for this and related processes in @xmath0 collisions @xcite .", "indeed , the resulting structure is far more complicated than that in sidis or the drell - yan process .", "however , it turns out that if one takes a certain weighted integral ( `` moment '' ) of the asymmetry , remarkable simplifications occur .", "this moment is defined by integrating the spin - dependent cross section with a factor @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the azimuthal imbalance between the two jets ( @xmath8 if the jets are exactly back - to - back in azimuth ) . for each of the various contributing @xmath3 partonic channels ,", "the gauge link then essentially collapses into a set of simple color factors that multiply contributions from color - gauge invariant subamplitudes to the given partonic process .", "one may , in fact , for convenience choose to absorb these factors into the hard - scattering functions , and _ define _ the sivers functions as the functions measured in the ssa in sidis . in this way , the net effect of the gauge links on the @xmath6-moment of the spin - dependent cross section is to generate new partonic hard - scattering functions that are different from the usual spin - independent ones , but that are actually similarly simple in structure .    at the same time , taking the moment of the factorized spin - dependent cross section leads to a new expression that involves only a certain moment of the sivers functions in partonic transverse momentum @xmath9 , rather than the fully transverse - momentum dependent functions themselves . as was shown in  @xcite , these @xmath9-moments of the sivers functions are directly related to twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions first introduced in  @xcite to describe the ssa for single - inclusive hadron production in hadronic scattering . by now , quite some knowledge about these correlation functions has been gathered from phenomenological studies  @xcite of the corresponding data .", "the upshot of all this is that it has now become possible for the first time to make predictions for the @xmath6-moment of the single - transverse spin asymmetry in dijet production at rhic that correctly take into account the process - dependence of the sivers functions and incorporate phenomenological information on some properties of the functions that is available from other measurements .", "this is the goal of this note ."], ["we study azimuthal correlations of two jets produced nearly `` back -
